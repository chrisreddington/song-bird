# GitHub Pong 3D 🏓 + Scream Invaders 👾

Two webcam-controlled games, zero dependencies to install.

## Games

### [Scream Invaders](scream-invaders.html) 👾🎤

A Space Invaders clone where your keyboard is useless and your dignity is optional.

- **Webcam** tracks your face -- tilt your head to move
- **Microphone** controls your weapon -- quiet noise = single shot, yell = triple burst, full scream = screen-clearing beam
- **Voice commands** -- say "LEFT" or "RIGHT" out loud

By wave 5 you'll be standing up. By wave 7 someone will come check on you. This is working as intended.

### [GitHub Pong 3D](index.html) 🏓

A 3D pong game themed after the GitHub contribution graph, with webcam eyebrow-tracking controls.

- **Raise your eyebrows** to move your paddle up
- **2-Player Mode** -- two faces detected = two human players
- **AI Opponent** -- one face = you vs. computer
- **Head-coupled parallax** -- 3D camera adjusts based on your head position
